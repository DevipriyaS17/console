# Redfish Systems Resource

## Overview

The Systems resource represents computer systems in the Redfish data model, providing access to ComputerSystem schema information derived from Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) data. This resource is device-specific and handles the mapping between AMT capabilities and standardized Redfish system representations.
